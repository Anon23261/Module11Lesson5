# DevOps Tasks and Instructions

## Frontend Deployment Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up development environment
  - Install Node.js and npm
  - Configure environment variables
  - Set up version control with Git

### 2. Build and Test
- [ ] Configure build process
  - Set up continuous integration pipeline
  - Implement automated testing
  - Configure code quality checks

### 3. Deployment
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline
  - Configure staging environment
  - Set up production environment
  - Implement automated deployment

### 4. Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up monitoring
  - Configure error tracking
  - Set up performance monitoring
  - Implement logging

## Implementation Steps

1. Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

2. Continuous Integration Setup
```bash
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

3. Deployment Setup
```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod
```

## Best Practices

1. Version Control
- Use feature branches
- Follow conventional commits
- Implement code review process

2. Security
- Implement security scanning
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regular dependency updates

3. Performance
- Implement code splitting
- Enable caching
- Optimize assets

4. Monitoring
- Set up error tracking
- Monitor performance metrics
- Implement logging

## Environment Variables
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Build production assets
- [ ] Check environment variables
- [ ] Verify API endpoints
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor for errors
